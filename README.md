Smart Environnement is an android app that monitor environmental parameters : Temperature, humidity, air quality ( Carbone Monoxyde level)
Based on the IoT principles ( Arduino Board + MQ7 sensor + DHT21 sensor + ESP8266 ), and on a realtime database (Firebase), 
"Smart Environnement" shows realtime values of temperature, humidity and air quality, and represents the variation of CO level per unit of time
Also, this app shows alerts and sends notification when CO level reaches the threshold (15 ppm).
